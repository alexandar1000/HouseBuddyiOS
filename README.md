# HouseBuddy iOS

HouseBuddy is, as the name suggest, a "buddy" to the house. Whatever the house may be, there are things to organize. Since it can be difficult to keep track of the things which need to be done in a house, HouseBuddy tries to help. It significantly shortens the time needed for the organization among people, and stores everything in one place which is easily accessible to everyone, even on the go.
